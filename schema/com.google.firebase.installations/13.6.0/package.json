  "description": "The Firebase installations service (FIS) provides a Firebase installation ID (FID) for each installed instance of a Firebase app. The Firebase installation ID is used internally by Firebase services such as In-App Messaging or Remote Config without requiring developers to interact directly with the FIS API. Using this API, a developer can delete a Firebase installation and the data tied to it, target specific app installations, and retrieve installation auth tokens.",
